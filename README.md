Hi this is my blog about craft brewing that I created with the help of the Django framework
in the project I used the MVC model of separation. I implemented simple and convenient KRUD functionality using OOP principles.

I created mixins in a file for conveniently creating handlers for each of the CRUD functions. Handlers classes inherit from mixins.
Model methods that pass the absolute url to the instance of the model class have been created for convenient communication of handler functions and templates.

Description of the problem: while reading articles and books about craft brewing, I always left excerpts and links in VK notes.
It was unstructured and uncomfortable. Now it is easy and I can share knowleges.
